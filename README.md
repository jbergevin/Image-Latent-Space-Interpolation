# Image-Latent-Space-Interpolation
This code uses hand-drawn images of crabs from the Quick, Draw! dataset (https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). Interpolating the images by pixel yields blurry images that only look like crabs if the original crab image remains somewhat intact. Thus, an autoencoder was used to change the dimensionality of the image to preserve the information that represents crabs. The compressed images from the autoencoder were then organized via a self organizing map, then the updated compressed images were un-encoded to produce images in the original dimension. Finally, a gif of the updated images is output to illustrate the interpolation between crabs.
